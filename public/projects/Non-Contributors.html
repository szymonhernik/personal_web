        <p>This book is part of the project on concept of resonance in modern politics. It includes texts from the book <i>The Future of the New Artistic Innovation in Times of Social Acceleration</i> as well as a collage with letters from a “feedback section” in Radical Software, a ’70s newsletter for an “alternative television movement”.</p>

          II’m a designer born in Poland and based in the Netherlands, where I’m doing my BA in Graphic Design at Royal Academy of Art in The Hague (KABK). In my practise I combine graphic design with autonomous projects involving writing, research
          and sound. The most often interests I touch upon with my work are: decentralization, political listening, nature, in-between spaces. I work both on self-initiated projects as well as collaborate with other artists and collectives.
