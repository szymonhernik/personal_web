        <p>The project emerged after Poland’s independent media staged the blackout protest on February 10 to raise the concerns over media freedoms. It’s a platform allowing people to log the voice message that gets automatically transcribed. The ongoing collective sound archive is the result of staged conversations and misusage.</p>

          II’m a designer born in Poland and based in the Netherlands, where I’m doing my BA in Graphic Design at Royal Academy of Art in The Hague (KABK). In my practise I combine graphic design with autonomous projects involving writing, research
          and sound. The most often interests I touch upon with my work are: decentralization, political listening, nature, in-between spaces. I work both on self-initiated projects as well as collaborate with other artists and collectives.
